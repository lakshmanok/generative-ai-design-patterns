# generative-ai-design-patterns
A [catalog](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lakshmanok/generative-ai-design-patterns/blob/main/catalog.html) of design patterns when building generative AI applications

## What are Design Patterns?
Design Patterns are common solutions to recurring problems. The solutions are not perfect - each of them comes with tradeoffs and a choice of one often brings about new problems that need to be addressed. So, an experienced practitioner will have to be pragmatic when choosing among these solutions.

Hannes Hapke and I are co-authoring a companion book to the O'Reilly book [Machine Learning Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Design-Patterns-Preparation/dp/1098115783).
This book will be focused on GenAI design patterns and this repository captures our code and progress on the book.

You can find the catalog on GitHub here:
