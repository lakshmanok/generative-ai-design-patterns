            Express constraints in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) using GGML -- this is called GNBF.
            The model will use these constraints to change the token probabilities
            to ensure that only legal next-tokens receive non-zero probabilities.

            Because this is just a constraint on how the next token is chosen,
