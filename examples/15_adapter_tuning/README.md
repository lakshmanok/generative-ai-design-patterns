# Adapter Tuning

To replicate the example for this pattern, you will need to:


## Step 1: Download and prepare the radiology dataset
Run the notebook 1_prepare_data.ipynb

## Step 2: Try a foundational model
Run the notebook 2_pretrained.ipynb

## Step 3: Sign up on HuggingFace
We will be adapter tuning the Gemma model.
You will need to accept its license on Hugging Face by clicking on the Agree and access repository button on the model page at: 
http://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-4b-pt

## Step 4: Get a sufficiently large machine with a GPU.
We used a NVIDIA L4 with 32 GB of memory machine on Google Cloud

## Step 5: Adapter Tuning
Run the notebook 3_adapter_tuning.ipynb
