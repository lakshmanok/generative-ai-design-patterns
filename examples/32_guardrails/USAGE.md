## Usage

Documented uses of Guardrails in the wild:
* QED42 built [prompt-based Guardrails](https://www.qed42.com/insights/building-simple-effective-prompt-based-guardrails) with policies, exceptions, and few-shot examples around a LLM-powered search application at a legal entity. The Guardrails filtered out non-legal query inputs and ensured that the outputs were relevant.
