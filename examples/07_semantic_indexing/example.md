# Johann Sebastian Bach

**Johann Sebastian Bach** (31 March [O.S. 21 March] 1685 – 28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the late Baroque period. He is known for instrumental compositions such as the Brandenburg Concertos and the Goldberg Variations, and vocal music such as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor. Since the 19th-century Bach Revival, he has been generally regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music.

## Early life and education

Bach was born in Eisenach, in the duchy of Saxe-Eisenach, into a great musical family. His father, Johann Ambrosius Bach, was the director of the town musicians, and all of his uncles were professional musicians. His father taught him to play violin and harpsichord, and his brother, Johann Christoph Bach, taught him the clavichord and exposed him to much contemporary music.

### Musical training

At the age of 14, Bach, along with his older school friend Georg Erdmann, was awarded a choral scholarship to study at the prestigious St. Michael's School in Lüneburg in the Principality of Lüneburg. This was a significant step up in terms of both his academic and musical education. There he played the three-manual organ and harpsichord. He came into contact with sons of noblemen from northern Germany sent to the highly selective school to prepare for careers in other disciplines.

## Career

### Early career (1703–1708)

Bach's first position was as court musician in the chapel of Duke Johann Ernst III in Weimar. His role there is unclear, but likely included menial, non-musical duties. During his seven-month tenure at Weimar, his reputation as a keyboardist spread so much that he was invited to inspect the new organ, and give its inaugural recital, at the New Church (now Bach Church) in Arnstadt, located about 30 kilometers (19 mi) southwest of Weimar.

### Arnstadt to Weimar (1708–1717)

In 1708, Bach left Mühlhausen, returning to Weimar this time as organist and from 1714 Konzertmeister (director of music) at the ducal court, where he had an opportunity to work with a large, well-funded contingent of professional musicians. Bach moved with his family into an apartment very close to the ducal palace. In the following year, their first child was born and they were joined by Maria Barbara's elder, unmarried sister, who remained with them to assist in the running of the household until her death in 1729.

### Köthen (1717–1723)

Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen, hired Bach to serve as his Kapellmeister (director of music) in 1717. Prince Leopold, himself a musician, appreciated Bach's talents, paid him well, and gave him considerable latitude in composing and performing. The prince was Calvinist and did not use elaborate music in his worship; accordingly, most of Bach's work from this period was secular, including the Orchestral Suites, the Six Suites for Unaccompanied Cello, the Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin, and the Brandenburg Concertos.

### Leipzig (1723–1750)

In 1723, Bach was appointed Cantor of the Thomasschule at the Thomaskirche in Leipzig, as well as Director of Music in the principal churches in the town. This was a prestigious post in the mercantile city in the Electorate of Saxony, which he held for 27 years until his death. During this time he reached the height of his ability to compose and perform music.

## Musical style and works

### Organ works

Bach was best known during his lifetime as an organist, organ consultant, and composer of organ works in both the traditional German free genres—such as preludes, fantasias, and toccatas—and stricter forms, such as chorale preludes and fugues. He established a reputation at a young age for his great creativity and ability to integrate foreign styles into his organ works.

### Keyboard works

Bach wrote many works for harpsichord, some of which may also have been played on the clavichord or lute-harpsichord. His keyboard works include:
- The Well-Tempered Clavier (Books 1 and 2)
- Goldberg Variations
- Partitas
- English Suites
- French Suites
- Inventions and Sinfonias

### Orchestral works

Bach's best-known orchestral works are the Brandenburg Concertos, so named because he submitted them in the hope of gaining employment from Margrave Christian Ludwig of Brandenburg-Schwedt in 1721. His other orchestral works include:
- Orchestral Suites
- Violin Concertos
- Harpsichord Concertos

### Vocal works

Bach's vocal works include his cantatas, motets, masses, Magnificat, Passions, and oratorios. His most famous vocal works include:
- St Matthew Passion
- St John Passion
- Mass in B minor
- Christmas Oratorio

## Legacy and influence

### 18th century

In his own time, Bach was highly respected amongst his colleagues, although outside of this circle of German composers, his music was largely ignored until the early 19th century. During the late 18th and early 19th century, Bach was recognized by several prominent composers. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Frédéric Chopin, Robert Schumann, and Felix Mendelssohn were among his admirers; they began writing in a more contrapuntal style after being exposed to Bach's music.

### 19th century

In 1802, Johann Nikolaus Forkel published Ueber Johann Sebastian Bachs Leben, Kunst und Kunstwerke (On Johann Sebastian Bach's Life, Art and Works), the first biography of the composer, which contributed to his becoming known to a wider public.

### 20th century

During the 20th century, the process of recognizing the musical as well as the pedagogic value of some of the works continued, perhaps most notably in the promotion of the Cello Suites by Pablo Casals, the first major performer to record these suites. Another development has been the growth of the "authentic" or "period" performance practice, with performers using period instruments and historical techniques of the time.

## Personal life

### Family

Bach married twice and had 20 children, ten of whom survived to adulthood. His first wife was his second cousin, Maria Barbara Bach, with whom he had seven children. After her death in 1720, he married Anna Magdalena Wilcke, with whom he had 13 more children.

### Death

Bach died on 28 July 1750 at the age of 65. His death was caused by complications from eye surgery performed by the English eye surgeon John Taylor. He was buried at Old St. John's Cemetery in Leipzig.
