Politically, he reorganized much of Europe, abolishing the Holy Roman Empire and creating entities like the Confederation of the Rhine, the Duchy of Warsaw, and kingdoms in Italy, Spain, and Westphalia. He often placed relatives or allies in positions of power within these newly formed or expanded kingdoms, effectively establishing French client states. These actions directly challenged the existing European order, the power of traditional monarchies, and resulted in him ruling nearly all of Continental Europe either directly or through proxies, marking the zenith of the Napoleonic Empire.\n",
