Although\\r\\nonly their edges are exposed, we may infer that these layers run\\r\\ninto the upland on either side and underlie the entire district;\\r\\nthey are part of the foundation of solid rock which everywhere is\\r\\nfound beneath the loose materials of the surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ledges of the valley of our illustration are of sandstone.\\r\\nLooking closely at the rock we see that it is composed of myriads\\r\\nof grains of sand cemented together.

From the broad plat form in which the\\ncanyon has been cut rises a series of gigantic stairs, which are\\noften more than one thousand feet high and a score or more of\\nmiles in breadth. The retreating escarpments, the cliffs of the\\nmesas and buttes which they have left behind as outliers, and the\\nwalls of the ravines are carved into noble architectural forms--\\ninto cathedrals, pyramids, amphitheaters, towers, arches, and\\ncolonnades--by the processes of weathering aided by deflation. It\\nis thus by the help of the action of the wind that great plateaus\\nin arid regions are dissected and at last are smoothed away to\\nwaterless plains, either composed of naked rock, or strewed with\\nresidual gravels, or covered with drifting residual sand.\\n\\nThe specific gravity of air is 1/823 that of water. How does this\\nfact affect the weight of the material which each can carry at the\\nsame velocity?\\n\\nIf the rainfall should lessen in your own state to from five to\\nten inches a year, what changes would take place in the vegetation\\nof the country? in the soil? in the streams? in the erosion of\\nlleys? in the agencies chiefly at work in denuding the land?\\n\\nIn what way can a wind-carved pebble be distinguished from a\\nriver-worn pebble? from a glaciated pebble?\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nTHE SEA AND ITS SHORES\\n\\n\\nWe have already seen that the ocean is the goal at which the waste\\nof the land arrives. The mantle of rock waste, creeping down\\nslopes, is washed to the sea by streams, together with the\\nmaterial which the streams have worn from their beds and that\\ndissolved by underground waters. In arid regions the winds sweep\\nwaste either into bordering oceans or into more humid regions\\nwhere rivers take it up and carry it on to the sea. Glaciers\\ndeliver the load of their moraines either directly to the sea or\\nleave it for streams to transport to the same goal. All deposits\\nmade on the land, such as the flood plains of rivers, the silts of\\nlake beds, dune sands, and sheets of glacial drift, mark but\\npauses in the process which is to bring all the materials of the\\nland now above sea level to rest upon the ocean bed.\\n\\nBut the sea is also at work along all its shores as an agent of\\ndestruction, and we must first take up its work in erosion before\\nwe consider how it transports and deposits the waste of the land.\\n\\nSEA EROSION\\n\\nTHE SEA CLIFF AND THE ROCK BENCH. On many coasts the land fronts\\nthe ocean in a line of cliffs. To the edge of the cliffs there\\nlead down valleys and ridges, carved by running water, which, if\\nextended, would meet the water surface some way out from shore.\\nEvidently they are now abruptly cut short at the present shore\\nline because the land has been cut back.\\n\\nAlong the foot of the cliff lies a gently shelving bench of rock,\\nmore or less thickly veneered with sand and shingle. At low tide\\nits inner margin is laid bare, but at high tide it is covered\\nwholly, and the sea washes the base of the cliffs. A notch, of\\nwhich the SEA CLIFF and the ROCK BENCH are the two sides, has been\\ncut along the shore.\\n\\nWAVES. The position of the rock bench, with its inner margin\\nslightly above low tide, shows that it has been cut by some agent\\nwhich acts like a horizontal saw set at about sea level. This\\nagent is clearly the surface agitation of the water; it is the\\nwind-raised wave.\\n\\nAs a wave comes up the shelving bench the crest topples forward\\nand the wave \"breaks,\" striking a blow whose force is measured by\\nthe momentum of all its tons of falling water.', publication_year=1905, relevant_text='The high plateaus of northern Arizona and southern Utah, north of\\nthe Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, are composed of stratified\\nrocks more than ten thousand feet thick and of very gentle\\ninclination northward.
