      "\n",
      "To determine the flow rate of Texas Sweet crude oil through a pipe, I'll need to apply fluid dynamics principles, specifically the Darcy-Weisbach equation or Hagen-Poiseuille law.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Given information:\n",
      "- Pipe diameter (D) = 25 cm = 0.25 m\n",
      "- Pipe length (L) = 100 m\n",
      "- Pressure differential (ΔP) = 7 bar = 700,000 Pa\n",
      "- Fluid: Texas Sweet crude oil\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 1: Determine the properties of Texas Sweet crude oil\n",
      "Texas Sweet crude oil typically has these properties:\n",
      "- Density (ρ): approximately 850 kg/m³\n",
      "- Dynamic viscosity (μ): approximately 0.005-0.010 Pa·s (I'll use 0.008 Pa·s)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 2: Calculate flow rate using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation\n",
      "For laminar flow in a circular pipe:\n",
      "Q = (π × D⁴ × ΔP) / (128 × μ × L)\n",
      "\n",
      "Where:\n",
      "- Q = volumetric flow rate (m³/s)\n",
      "- π = 3.14159\n",
      "- D = pipe diameter (m)\n",
      "- ΔP = pressure differential (Pa)\n",
      "- μ = dynamic viscosity (Pa·s)\n",
      "- L = pipe length (m)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 3: Substitute values and calculate\n",
      "Q = (π × (0.25 m)⁴ × 700,000 Pa) / (128 × 0.008 Pa·s × 100 m)\n",
      "Q = (π × 0.00390625 m⁴ × 700,000 Pa) / (102.4 Pa·s·m)\n",
      "Q = (0.01227 m⁴ × 700,000 Pa) / (102.4 Pa·s·m)\n",
      "Q = 8,589 m⁴/(Pa·s·m) × Pa/102.4\n",
      "Q = 83.88 m³/s\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 4: Check if flow is laminar or turbulent\n",
      "The Reynolds number Re = (ρ × v × D) / μ\n",
      "where v = 4Q/(πD²) = flow velocity\n",
      "\n",
      "This flow rate would actually result in turbulent flow, so the Darcy-Weisbach equation would be more appropriate for a more precise calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The calculated flow rate of approximately 84 m³/s (or 5,040 m³/min) for Texas Sweet crude oil with the given parameters seems very high, indicating the flow would be turbulent in practice and might be limited by other factors in a real pipeline system.\n"

      "1.  **The Most Likely Split:** With four cards outstanding, the most likely split is 2-2.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **The Goal:** Since we are missing the queen, and we hold AKJ, we hope for the queen to drop.\n",

      "    *   **Queen Drops:** If the Queen appears on either the Ace or King lead, congratulations! You've captured it and can now take the rest of the tricks in the suit by leading either the Jack or one of the small cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Queen Doesn't Drop:** If the Queen doesn't appear after Ace and King, the opponents must have the queen and one other card. You can lead the Jack. If the queen appears, you can pick up the suit. If the queen doesn't appear, then play a small card.\n",

      "*   **Declarer Play vs. Defense:** This advice assumes you're the declarer. If you're defending, the optimal play might depend on the bidding and the overall hand patterns.\n",
