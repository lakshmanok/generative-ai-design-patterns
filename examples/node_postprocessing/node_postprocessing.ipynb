It learns from\\r\\ntheir composition and structure how the rocks were made and how\\r\\nthey have been modified. It ascertains how they have been brought\\r\\nto their present places and wrought to their various topographic\\r\\nforms, such as hills and valleys, plains and mountains. It studies\\r\\nthe vestiges which the rocks preserve of ancient organisms which\\r\\nonce inhabited our planet. Geology is the history of the earth and\\r\\nits inhabitants, as read in the rocks of the earth's crust.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo obtain a general idea of the nature and method of our science\\r\\nbefore beginning its study in detail, we may visit some valley,\\r\\nsuch as that illustrated in the frontispiece, on whose sides are\\r\\nrocky ledges. Here the rocks lie in horizontal layers. Although\\r\\nonly their edges are exposed, we may infer that these layers run\\r\\ninto the upland on either side and underlie the entire district;\\r\\nthey are part of the foundation of solid rock which everywhere is\\r\\nfound beneath the loose materials of the surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ledges of the valley of our illustration are of sandstone.\\r\\nLooking closely at the rock we see that it is composed of myriads\\r\\nof grains of sand cemented together. These grains have been worn\\r\\nand rounded. They are sorted also, those of each layer being about\\r\\nof a size. By some means they have been brought hither from some\\r\\nmore ancient source. Surely these grains have had a history before\\r\\nthey here found a resting place,--a history which we are to learn\\r\\nto read.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe successive layers of the rock suggest that they were built one\\r\\nafter another from the bottom upward. We may be as sure that each\\r\\nlayer was formed before those above it as that the bottom courses\\r\\nof stone in a wall were laid before the courses which rest upon\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have no reason to believe that the lowest layers which we see\\r\\nhere were the earliest ever formed. Indeed, some deep boring in\\r\\nthe vicinity may prove that the ledges rest upon other layers of\\r\\nrock which extend downward for many hundreds of feet below the\\r\\nvalley floor. Nor may we conclude that the highest layers here\\r\\nwere the latest ever laid; for elsewhere we may find still later\\r\\nlayers lying upon them.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short search may find in the rock relics of animals, such as the\\r\\nimprints of shells, which lived when it was deposited; and as\\r\\nthese are of kinds whose nearest living relatives now have their\\r\\nhome in the sea, we infer that it was on the flat sea floor that\\r\\nthe sandstone was laid. Its present position hundreds of feet\\r\\nabove sea level proves that it has since emerged to form part of\\r\\nthe land; while the flatness of the beds shows that the movement\\r\\nwas so uniform and gentle as not to break or strongly bend them\\r\\nfrom their original attitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surface of some of these layers is ripple-marked.\""

It has not yet wholly reached grade, and the\\ngreat task of the river and its tributaries--the task of leveling\\nthe lofty plateau to a low plain and of transporting it grain by\\ngrain to the sea--still lies almost entirely in the future.\\n\\nWATERFALLS AND RAPIDS. Before the bed of a stream is reduced to\\ngrade it may be broken by abrupt descents which give rise to\\nwaterfalls and rapids. Such breaks in a river's bed may belong to\\nthe initial surface over which it began its course; still more\\ncommonly are they developed in the rock mass through which it is\\ncutting its valley. Thus, wherever a stream leaves harder rocks to\\nflow over softer ones the latter are quickly worn below the level\\nof the former, and a sharp change in slope, with a waterfall or\\nrapid, results.\\n\\nAt time of flood young tributaries with steeper courses than that\\nof the trunk stream may bring down stones and finer waste, which\\nthe gentler current cannot move along, and throw them as a dam\\nacross its way. The rapids thus formed are also ephemeral, for as\\nthe gradient of the tributaries is lowered the main stream becomes\\nable to handle the smaller and finer load which they discharge.\\n\\nA rare class of falls is produced where the minor tributaries of a\\nyoung river are not able to keep pace with their master stream in\\nthe erosion of their beds because of their smaller volume, and\\nthus join it by plunging over the side of its gorge. But as the\\nriver approaches grade and slackens its down cutting, the\\ntributaries sooner or later overtake it, and effacing their falls,\\nunite with it on a level.\\n\\nWaterfalls and rapids of all kinds are evanescent features of a\\nriver's youth. Like lakes they are soon destroyed, and if any long\\ntime had already elapsed since their formation they would have\\nbeen obliterated already.\\n\\nLOCAL BASELEVELS. That balanced condition called grade, where a\\nriver neither degrades its bed by erosion nor aggrades it by\\ndeposition, is first attained along reaches of soft rocks,\\nungraded outcrops of hard rocks remaining as barriers which give\\nrise to rapids or falls. Until these barriers are worn away they\\nconstitute local baselevels, below which level the stream, up\\nvalley from them, cannot cut. They are eroded to grade one after\\nanother, beginning with the least strong, or the one nearest the\\nmouth of the stream. In a similar way the surface of a lake in a\\nriver's course constitutes for all inflowing streams a local\\nbaselevel, which disappears when the basin is filled or drained.\\n\\nMATURE AND OLD RIVERS\\n\\nMaturity is the stage of a river's complete development and most\\neffective work. The river system now has well under way its great\\ntask of wearing down the land mass which it drains and carrying it\\nparticle by particle to the sea. The relief of the land is now at\\nits greatest; for the main channels have been sunk to grade, while\\nthe divides remain but little worn below their initial altitudes.\\nGround water now stands low. The run-off washes directly to the\\nstreams, with the least delay and loss by evaporation in ponds and\\nmarches; the discharge of the river is therefore at its height.\\nThe entire region is dissected by stream ways. The area of valley\\nslopes is now largest and sheds to the streams a heavier load of\\nwaste than ever before. At maturity the river system is doing its\\ngreatest amount of work both in erosion and in the carriage of\\nwater and of waste to the sea.\", publication_year=1905, relevant_text='Running water has gulched the walls and weathering has everywhere attacked and driven them back.

The mantle of rock waste, creeping down\\nslopes, is washed to the sea by streams, together with the\\nmaterial which the streams have worn from their beds and that\\ndissolved by underground waters. In arid regions the winds sweep\\nwaste either into bordering oceans or into more humid regions\\nwhere rivers take it up and carry it on to the sea. Glaciers\\ndeliver the load of their moraines either directly to the sea or\\nleave it for streams to transport to the same goal. All deposits\\nmade on the land, such as the flood plains of rivers, the silts of\\nlake beds, dune sands, and sheets of glacial drift, mark but\\npauses in the process which is to bring all the materials of the\\nland now above sea level to rest upon the ocean bed.\\n\\nBut the sea is also at work along all its shores as an agent of\\ndestruction, and we must first take up its work in erosion before\\nwe consider how it transports and deposits the waste of the land.\\n\\nSEA EROSION\\n\\nTHE SEA CLIFF AND THE ROCK BENCH.

At low tide\\nits inner margin is laid bare, but at high tide it is covered\\nwholly, and the sea washes the base of the cliffs. A notch, of\\nwhich the SEA CLIFF and the ROCK BENCH are the two sides, has been\\ncut along the shore.\\n\\nWAVES. The position of the rock bench, with its inner margin\\nslightly above low tide, shows that it has been cut by some agent\\nwhich acts like a horizontal saw set at about sea level. This\\nagent is clearly the surface agitation of the water; it is the\\nwind-raised wave.\\n\\nAs a wave comes up the shelving bench the crest topples forward\\nand the wave \"breaks,\" striking a blow whose force is measured by\\nthe momentum of all its tons of falling water.', publication_year=1905, relevant_text='The high plateaus of northern Arizona and southern Utah, north of\\nthe Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, are composed of stratified\\nrocks more than ten thousand feet thick and of very gentle\\ninclination northward.
