Darius drew out his army upon learning of Alexander's approach, but hills obscured their view. Nearing the enemy, Alexander halted the phalanx and convened a council. Despite some urging immediate attack, Parmenio advised reconnaissance to check for obstacles and assess enemy tactics. Alexander scouted the area with light infantry and cavalry, then addressed his leaders, emphasizing their past valor and the high stakes of the upcoming battle for Asia. He stressed discipline, silent advancement, and a unified, loud battle cry, urging quick obedience and transmission of orders. After exhorting his officers and receiving their encouragement, Alexander ordered dinner and rest for the soldiers.\n",

Alexander, with select troops, rushed to aid Philotas, while leaving the rest of his army to contain the city's inhabitants. Glaucias and Clitus saw an opportunity to trap Alexander, but the foraging party safely returned to camp.\n",

Alexander then commanded his troops to raise a battle cry and clash their spears on their shields, further alarming the enemy, who retreated to the city.\n",

      "Darius and his forces, including Persians, Indians, Albanians, and Carians, engaged Alexander's army at Arbela. The Persians marched parallel to Alexander, attempting to outflank him. Scythian cavalry clashed with the front of Alexander's line. Darius, fearing his chariots would be useless on uneven ground, ordered his left wing to ride around Alexander's right wing. Grecian mercenaries were routed by the Scythian cavalry and Bactrians, who were more numerous and better armored. Alexander then ordered Aristo to attack the Scythians, and the barbarians gave way. The Bactrians renewed the battle, causing a general cavalry engagement with many Macedonian casualties. The Persians launched scythe-bearing chariots against Alexander's phalanx, but the Agrianians and javelin-men countered them. Some chariots passed through the ranks, but the drivers were later overpowered.\n",
