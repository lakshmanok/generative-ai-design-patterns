Recent breakthroughs in AI have not only increased demand for AI products, they've also lowered the barriers to entry for those who want to build AI products. The model-as-a-service approach has transformed AI from an esoteric discipline into a powerful development tool that anyone can use. Everyone, including those with minimal or no prior AI experience, can now leverage AI models to build applications. In this book, author Chip Huyen discusses AI engineering: the process of building applications with readily available foundation models.

The book starts with an overview of AI engineering, explaining how it differs from traditional ML engineering and discussing the new AI stack. The more AI is used, the more opportunities there are for catastrophic failures, and therefore, the more important evaluation becomes. This book discusses different approaches to evaluating open-ended models, including the rapidly growing AI-as-a-judge approach.

AI application developers will discover how to navigate the AI landscape, including models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, and the seemingly infinite number of use cases and application patterns. You'll learn a framework for developing an AI application, starting with simple techniques and progressing toward more sophisticated methods, and discover how to efficiently deploy these applications.

Understand what AI engineering is and how it differs from traditional machine learning engineering
Learn the process for developing an AI application, the challenges at each step, and approaches to address them
Explore various model adaptation techniques, including prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, agents, and dataset engineering, and understand how and why they work
Examine the bottlenecks for latency and cost when serving foundation models and learn how to overcome them
Choose the right model, dataset, evaluation benchmarks, and metrics for your needs
Chip Huyen works to accelerate data analytics on GPUs at Voltron Data. Previously, she was with Snorkel AI and NVIDIA, founded an AI infrastructure startup, and taught Machine Learning Systems Design at Stanford. She's the author of the book Designing Machine Learning Systems, an Amazon bestseller in AI.

AI Engineering builds upon and is complementary to Designing Machine Learning Systems (O'Reilly).

Machine learning systems are both complex and unique. Complex because they consist of many different components and involve many different stakeholders. Unique because they're data dependent, with data varying wildly from one use case to the next. In this book, you'll learn a holistic approach to designing ML systems that are reliable, scalable, maintainable, and adaptive to changing environments and business requirements.

Author Chip Huyen, co-founder of Claypot AI, considers each design decision--such as how to process and create training data, which features to use, how often to retrain models, and what to monitor--in the context of how it can help your system as a whole achieve its objectives. The iterative framework in this book uses actual case studies backed by ample references.

This book will help you tackle scenarios such as:

Engineering data and choosing the right metrics to solve a business problem
Automating the process for continually developing, evaluating, deploying, and updating models
Developing a monitoring system to quickly detect and address issues your models might encounter in production
Architecting an ML platform that serves across use cases
Developing responsible ML systems

Generative AI has revolutionized how organizations tackle problems, accelerating the journey from concept to prototype to solution. While these applications enhance efficiency, they often require extensive planning, drafting, and revising to complete complex tasks. By combining many of these actions, AI agents offer greater autonomy and efficiency, but understanding and deploying them remains a challenge for many organizations, especially as technology and research rapidly develops.

This book is your indispensable guide through this intricate and fast-moving landscape. Author Michael Albada provides a practical and research-based approach to designing and implementing single- and multi-agent systems. It simplifies the complexities and equips you with the tools to move from concept to solution efficiently. By the end, you'll:

Understand the distinct features of foundation model-enabled AI agents
Discover the core components and design principles of AI agents
Explore design trade-offs and implement effective multi-agent systems
Design and deploy tailored AI solutions, enhancing efficiency and innovation in your field
Michael Albada is a seasoned machine learning engineer with expertise in deploying large-scale solutions for major tech firms including Uber, ServiceNow, and Microsoft. He holds degrees from Stanford University, the University of Cambridge, and Georgia Tech, specializing in machine learning.

Large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion have unprecedented potential. Because they have been trained on all the public text and images on the internet, they can make useful contributions to a wide variety of tasks. And with the barrier to entry greatly reduced today, practically any developer can harness LLMs and diffusion models to tackle problems previously unsuitable for automation.

With this book, you'll gain a solid foundation in generative AI, including how to apply these models in practice. When first integrating LLMs and diffusion models into their workflows, most developers struggle to coax reliable enough results from them to use in automated systems. Authors James Phoenix and Mike Taylor show you how a set of principles called prompt engineering can enable you to work effectively with AI.

Learn how to empower AI to work for you. This book explains:

The structure of the interaction chain of your program's AI model and the fine-grained steps in between
How AI model requests arise from transforming the application problem into a document completion problem in the model training domain
The influence of LLM and diffusion model architecture—and how to best interact with it
How these principles apply in practice in the domains of natural language processing, text and image generation, and code
